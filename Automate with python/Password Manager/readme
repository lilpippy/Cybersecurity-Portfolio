Password manager script purpose is to improve credential management and mitigate risks associated with weak or poorly managed passwords.

Key Points:
Threat Analysis and Mitigation:
By requiring passwords and usernames of at least 8 characters, the script enforces a basic level of security.
It stores credentials securely (to some extent), helping users mitigate the risk of losing access to accounts or creating overly simplistic credentials.

Features
Add Credentials:

Prompts the user to input a URL/resource name, a username, and a password.
Enforces a minimum length of 8 characters for both username and password.
Stores the credentials in a dictionary (credentials) during runtime.
Appends the credentials to a file (credentials.txt) for persistent storage.
View Stored Credentials:

Reads and displays all stored credentials from the credentials.txt file.
Ensures that previously added credentials are accessible even after restarting the script.
Exit Option:

Allows the user to exit the application.

Limitations
No Encryption:
The credentials are stored in plain text in credentials.txt, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
Basic Validation:
Only enforces a minimum length for usernames and passwords; no other security checks are implemented.
Manual Retrieval:
Credentials must be retrieved manually by reading the file or using the script.
